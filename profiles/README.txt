This folder contains examples of profiles for the library transliteration_profile_iconv,
the file 1UnicodeData_10.0.0.txt from site unicode.org (this file may be out of date as may be the example profiles),
and PHP scripts to generate some of these profiles.
The profiles themselves are not copyrighted and are at least partly generated by the scripts.
Every user of the library should modify the example profiles or create profiles from scratch, 
since the default profiles have no added functionnality compared to standard iconv() function.
